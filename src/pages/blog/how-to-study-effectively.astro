        <h1>How to study effectively</h1>
        <p>
            Research shows active recall and spaced repetition are among the most
            effective study techniques. Using practice tests and low-stakes quizzes
            helps strengthen memory retrieval and identify gaps in knowledge.
        </p>

        <h2>Active recall</h2>
        <p>
            Active recall is the practice of retrieving information from memory, for
            example by answering quiz questions without looking at notes.
            selftest.in is built around this principle.
        </p>

        <h2>Spaced repetition</h2>
        <p>
            Spacing study sessions over time improves long-term retention. Combine
            generated quizzes with a schedule to get better results.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical tips</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Generate short quizzes and take them regularly.</li>
            <li>Review explanations for questions you missed.</li>
            <li>Keep sessions focused and limit duration to avoid fatigue.</li>
